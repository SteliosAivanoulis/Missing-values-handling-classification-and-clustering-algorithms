# Missing-values-handling-classification-and-clustering-algorithms

The purpose of this project was to efficiently handle the missing values in a dataset based on their nature, and perform classification and clustering algorithms on them. The clustering algorithms that were used were DBSCAN, Agglomerative clustering, and K-Means. As for classification, the algorithms that were executed and compared were Multinomial Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier.
